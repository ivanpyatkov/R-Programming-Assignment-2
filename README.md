Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

This second programming assignment.
Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and their
may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather
than compute it repeatedly.

My assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache
the inverse of a matrix.
